# Superstore Sales Capstone Dashboard

This project is my final Data Visualization Apps (BUA 610) capstone for graduate-level coursework in Data Science. It analyzes Superstore sales, profitability, and shipping trends using both **Power BI** and **Tableau**, combining business intelligence with design clarity.

## üìä Tools Used
- **Power BI** (DAX, Power Query, KPIs, maps)
- **Tableau** (Calculated fields, storytelling, filters)

## üîç Key Insights
